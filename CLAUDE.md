## Project Architecture

This is a Next.js 14 TypeScript application that renders interactive Mandelbrot set fractals using Canvas API. Key architectural decisions:

### Core Rendering System

- **FractalRenderer** (`src/lib/fractalRenderer.ts`): Canvas-based rendering engine with progressive rendering and cancellation support
- **Mandelbrot calculations** (`src/lib/mandelbrot.ts`): Core mathematical functions for fractal generation
- **ZoomPanManager** (`src/lib/zoomPan.ts`): Interactive controls for navigation
- **ColorMapping** (`src/lib/colorMapping.ts`): Dynamic color schemes for visualization

### State Management Pattern

The main page (`src/app/page.tsx`) uses React hooks for:

- `bounds`: Current fractal view coordinates (FractalBounds)
- `isRendering/progress`: Rendering state and progress tracking
- Parameter controls: iterations, color schemes, canvas resolution
- Preset system: Built-in and custom fractal configurations

### Component Structure

- **UI Components** (`src/components/ui/`): Reusable form controls (Slider, Select, Input, Button)
- **Specialized Controls**: ZoomDisplay, CenterControls, PresetSelector, CustomPresetManager
- **Layout**: Single-page application with side-by-side canvas and control panels

### Performance Optimizations

- Progressive rendering with chunked calculations to avoid UI blocking
- Cancellable rendering operations when parameters change
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth updates
- Canvas ImageData direct pixel manipulation

## Next.js Configuration

The application uses Next.js with these key settings:

- `output: 'standalone'` for Docker deployment
- `poweredByHeader: false` for security
- `reactStrictMode: true` for development checks
- `swcMinify: true` for production optimization
- TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- Path aliases configured (`@/*` maps to `./src/*`)
- Tailwind CSS with custom HSL color variables for theming

## Testing and Quality

ESLint for code quality and Vitest for unit tests. Tests live in
`src/**/__tests__/*.test.ts` and cover the pure logic in `src/lib` plus the
`/api/health` route; `vitest.config.mts` aliases `@/*` to `src/*` and pins the
node environment, so a test must not need a browser, canvas or network.

The CI pipeline runs:

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Deployment

### Docker Configuration

- Multi-stage Dockerfile optimized for container deployment
- Standalone Next.js output for minimal container size
- Runs on port 8080 with non-root user for security
- Health endpoint at `/api/health` for container orchestration probes

### CI/CD Pipeline

There is no deploy pipeline in this repo. The landing gate
(`.forgejo/workflows/gate.yml`) runs `make gate` on a `land/**` branch; it needs
no cloud credentials. Build and deploy happen on the deploy runner, through the
devops system, run by the human. See the Gas Town rules at the end of this file.

## Version Notes

_Last updated: 2026-10-07_

### eslint-plugin-react-hooks 7.1.x (2026-10-07)

- The `~7.0.1` pin is gone; the plugin resolves on 7.1.1. The four
  `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` sites are refactored rather than
  suppressed, so the rule stays an error:
  - `PresetSelector` and `CustomPresetManager` read the saved presets through
    `useSyncExternalStore` instead of an effect that copied localStorage into
    state. `src/lib/presets.ts` now owns the store half of that contract
    (`subscribeToCustomPresets`, `getCustomPresetsSnapshot`,
    `getServerCustomPresetsSnapshot`), and `save`/`delete` notify it. The
    snapshot is keyed on the stored string so its identity is stable between
    changes — a fresh array per call would loop the hook — and it is frozen,
    because one array serves as both the client cache and the server
    snapshot.
  - `CenterControls` and the page's manual coordinate inputs adjust their
    state during the render that sees new bounds, comparing against the bounds
    they were last synced from. The effect that did this ran after commit, so
    the inputs could paint one stale frame; the render-phase version cannot.
- `getCustomPresets()` still reads storage afresh on every call, so callers may
  keep mutating the list it returns.

### Dependency Refresh (2026-10-07)

- `next` and `eslint-config-next` moved to 16.4.0; every other package was
  refreshed to the newest release its existing major allows (eslint 9.39.5,
  typescript 5.9.3, tailwindcss 3.4.19, typescript-eslint 8.71.1, prettier
  3.9.9, and the `@types/*` packages)
- `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` was pinned to `~7.0.1` here, because 7.1.1 turns
  its new `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` analysis loose on four pre-existing
  components. Those four are refactored and the pin is gone as of the section
  below.
- `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` stays on 0.6.x for the same Node reason as the
  Vite pin below: both 0.7.0 and 0.8.1 declare `engines.node >= 20.19`, and the
  gate image is Node 20.18.1. Revisit it alongside the Vite pin.
- Tailwind 3, ESLint 9, TypeScript 5 and Vite 6 are all held at their current
  major deliberately; each has a newer major (4, 10, 7, 8) that is out of scope
  for a dependency refresh. React is off that list as of the React 19 section
  below.
- `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` is clean. The remaining audit
  findings are dev-only and have no upgrade path today: `braces` and
  `micromatch` are reported as vulnerable at *every* published version, and the
  rest of the chain (chokidar, fast-glob, postcss-nested) only clears by
  moving to Tailwind 4 or waiting on upstream.

### React 19 (2026-10-07)

- `react`, `react-dom`, `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` moved together to
  19.3.0. Next.js 16 still *runs* on React 18, but prints "React 18 support is
  deprecated in Next.js 16 and will be removed in Next.js 17" on every
  `next build`, so React 19 is the supported target going into Next 17.
- The switch needed no source change. React 19 drops `ReactDOM.render`,
  `findDOMNode`, `unmountComponentAtNode`, string refs, `createFactory`, and
  `defaultProps`/`propTypes` on function components; none are used here. The
  four `React.FC` components (`CenterControls`, `CustomPresetManager`,
  `PresetSelector`, `ZoomDisplay`) take no implicit `children`, so the 19 types
  are satisfied as written.
- `npm run build` is warning-free and `make gate` is green on the same
  60-test Vitest suite as before.

### Vitest Test Suite (2026-10-07)

- Added Vitest (`vitest run` via the `test` npm script and the `test`
  Makefile target) covering `src/lib` and the `/api/health` route
- The config is `vitest.config.mts` so Vitest's native loader reads it as ESM
- `vite` is pinned to the 6.x line on purpose. The landing gate's `ci-base`
  image ships Node 20.18.1, and Vite 8's rolldown bundler wants
  `engines.node` `^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`. npm drops *optional* dependencies
  that fail their engine check, so on that image rolldown's native binding
  was silently never installed and vitest died at startup. Vite 6 (rollup +
  esbuild) runs on Node 20.18. Revisit the pin when `ci-base` moves past
  Node 20.19.

### Deploy Pipelines Moved to the DevOps System (2026-10-07)

- Removed the cloud CI pipeline from the repo root and both files under
  `.github/workflows/`; this repo no longer carries a deploy pipeline
- Deployment is done only by the human, through the devops system
- The image contract is unchanged: root `Dockerfile`, `$PORT` (8080),
  `/api/health`, no baked secrets

### Next.js 16 + ESLint 9 Migration

- Upgraded to Next.js 16.1.1 with ESLint 9 flat config
- `next lint` removed in Next.js 16 - now using `eslint .` directly
- ESLint config migrated to `eslint.config.mjs` flat config format
- Removed deprecated `swcMinify` option from `next.config.js`

### Potential Improvements

- **Testing**: UI components (`src/components/ui`) still have no tests; the
  suite covers only the pure logic in `src/lib` and the health route

## Gas Town rules (polecats and crew)

- Gate: `make gate` (npm ci, lint, typecheck, build, test) must pass with no network access to any cloud and no secrets. The landing gate runs the same command.
- You never have cloud credentials and never deploy. Do not run `gcloud`, `pulumi` or any cloud CLI, and do not add secrets, keys or tokens to the repo. Deployment is done only by the human through the devops system (see the `devops` rig's `docs/design.md`).
- The container contract the deploy system relies on: root `Dockerfile`, the server listens on `$PORT` (8080), health route `/api/health`, no baked secrets.
- Keep changes small and tested. Do not bump major versions beyond what your bead names.
